            <p>Hello, My name is Pete and I am currently attending Seattle Central College and persuing a certificate in Mobile App Development and Database Development. I have some experience with databases years ago. I worked at a dental supply wharehouse and learned Filemaker to build databases for the company. I moved on from Arnold Dental to work for Kibiz, a CRM/ERP Filemaker based database, and provided custom development solutions. I found that I realy enjoy working with databases and providing easy, efficient and fun user interfaces. 
            </p>
            <p>I choose clowns for my pictures because, well it was the first thing that came to mind. I know some people are afraid of clowns so I picked an odd clown, one that feeds me and one that scares the heck out of me. See if you can tell which is which.
            </p>
